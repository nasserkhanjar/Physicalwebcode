The Physical Web is an effort to extend the superpower of the web - the URL - to everyday physical objects. Our premise is that you should be able to walk up to any “smart” physical object (e.g. a vending machine, a poster, a toy, a bus stop, a rental car) and interact with it without first downloading an app. The user experience of smart objects should be much like links in a web browser, just tap and use.

At its base, the Physical Web is a discovery service: a smart object broadcasts relevant URLs that any nearby device can receive. This simple capability can unlock exciting new ways to interact with the Web.

## Why Physical Web?

A hidden world is being created that will change the way you acess information forever. Beneath your feet, in the walls of offices, on street lights
and underneath the products in stores, tiny beacons are being buried that broadcast a bluetooth signal. Some get online, others talk to each other, but all will soon communicate with your 
phone. This is the 'Physical Web'. these are some of real world examples where companies switched to beacons:
 
How does this work?
The Physical Web enables you to see a list of URLs broadcast by objects in the enviroment around you Any object can
be embedded with a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon, which is a low powered. battery efficient device that broadcasts content over
bluetooth. Beacons that support the Eddystone protocol specification can broadcast URLs. Services on your device such as Google Chrome or Nearby noticication 
can scan for and display these URLs after passing them through a proxy.
##Open Design
The Physical Web must be an open standard that everyone can use. This can’t be a product that is locked down by a single company. Like many web specifications, this is an open source design that is being released early so everyone can experiment and comment on it. There is much to discuss and add to this specification.
